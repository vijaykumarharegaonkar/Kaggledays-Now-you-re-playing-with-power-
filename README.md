Steam turbines are still used continuously today due to their successful stability in electric power generation for years. Other important factors are that the steam conditions have been improving and that steam turbines have been evolving and responding to electric power energy demand by rapidly adopting the latest analysis technologies for their design and applying up-to-date technologies for higher efficiency and reliability to actual products.

A steam power plant consists of a boiler, steam turbine and generator, and other auxiliaries. The boiler generates steam at high pressure and high temperature. The steam turbine converts the heat energy of steam into mechanical energy. The generator then converts the mechanical energy into electric power.
